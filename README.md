AIRBNB CLONE - CONSOLE
     This is the first technically practical project of ALX-SE programme. In this project I'm building a website from scratch liken to the Airbnb website. It is a console that helps build a website using  Airbnb as a prototype.
   This project will be of seven parts. The first one is this CONSOLE project and others will be released at later time. There are different programming languages and technologies to operate on viz; python, mysql, html, css, Reactjs, amongst others.
